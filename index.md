# Introduction

The Hisense [50A6N](https://qrcode.hisense.com/appliance/0000000000200138520000000000000000000?lang=en) is a chinese smart TV which offers 4K resolution. While the TV seems solid and is sold at a cheap price, it failed right after it went out the warranty, a defect in the screen's backlight board. This gave me an oportunity to pry it open and take a look at the insides of the boards.

The TV has 4 boards, not counting the flexible PCBs that the display uses. It's main board houses the power section, the on-board computer (since this is a smart TV, I assumed it used Android)
